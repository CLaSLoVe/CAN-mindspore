# 🌟 CAN in MindSpore - Competition Project 🏆

CAN (Context Aware Network) is a research work presented at ECCV 2022. It has shown remarkable performance in handwritten mathematical formula recognition. The project aims to reproduce CAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11463) in MindSpore. Here are the details and implementation plan for the project. 💡

## Steps 🚀

Here are the steps planned for our project:

1. Implement the CAN network based on the research paper and ensure successful execution. 💻
2. Utilize MindSpore 1.10.1 version with the Ascend backend for training and inference on a server. 🔧
3. Implement the 310lite inference functionality of the CAN model on MindSpore 1.10.1 version. 💡

## Objectives 🎯

Our ultimate goal is to successfully run the CAN model on the MindSpore platform and achieve the expected inference capabilities. 💪
